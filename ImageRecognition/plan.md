Goals: 
Recognition of hand positioning
Side view to correct positioning
See if the fingers are straight or bent
knowing which fingers are over which piano keys 
Detect piano key being pressed
if a finger is less than extension (shown via above camera)
Fingers go below a certain axis (shown via side camera)
Providing a feedback score of how hands are positioned, as well as if they are above the right notes (joined with UI)
Libraries:
OpenCV
MediaPipe

Questions:
Is this meant for beginner (teaching from scratch) or just giving feedback on your piano playing
